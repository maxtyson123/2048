# 2048
This is a clone of 2048, remade from scratch using regular HTML, JS, and CSS as an exercise to learn how to program proficiently in JavaScript. It started off as just a base copy of the original game, made in a couple of days, until later on when I decided to extend it to be more customizable, as I was inspired by other spinoff versions of 2048, such as the cupcakes version. My implementation now includes a theme creator, where the user can customize each tile and component of the board with variable colors, text, and images. Additionally, I added some game controls like a move cap, multiple boards, and a Tetris game mode. My last feature I added before I moved on from the project was to add a replay system to store and relive games played, move by move.
